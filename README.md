# BianchiPeriodPols
Code to compute period polynomials of Bianchi modular forms, their associated Hecke action, and other quantities of interest.

Also contains code to compute H^2 of Bianchi groups. 

Requires Gabor Wiese's package ArtinAlgebras to compute eigvenvalue systems. ArtinAlgebras can be downloaded [here](https://math.uni.lu/wiese/programs/ArtinAlgebras/index.html).
