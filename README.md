# BianchiPeriodPols
Code to compute period polynomials of Bianchi modular forms, their associated Hecke action, and other quantities of interest.

Requires Gabor Wiese's package ArtinAlgebras to compute eigvenvalue systems. ArtinAlgebras can be downloaded [here](https://math.uni.lu/wiese/programs/ArtinAlgebras/index.html).
